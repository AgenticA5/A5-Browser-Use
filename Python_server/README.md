# A5 Python Server

This directory contains the Python server component of the A5 Browser Automation Tool (mainly main.py). The server handles requests from the Chrome extension (or your own web application) and executes browser automation commands using the Browser Use library.

## Structure

The server consists of the following key components:

- `main.py`: Main server application
- `utils/`: Future: Utility functions and helpers
- `models/`: Future: Data models and database schemas
- `config/`: Future: Configuration files and environment variables

## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run the server using Python

## API Endpoints

The server will expose RESTful API endpoints for:

- Command execution
- Session management
- Status monitoring
- Error handling

Documentation for these endpoints will be provided as they are implemented.
