Folder Descriptions
Chrome_extension/: This folder will contain all the files related to the Chrome extension part of the project. Users will interact with this extension to send commands to the Python server.

Python_server/: This folder will house the Python server code that interfaces with the Browser Use library to execute browser commands based on RESTful API requests from the Chrome extension.

README.md: The documentation file that provides an overview, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution information.

.gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore. This is useful to prevent sensitive information or unnecessary files from being committed to the repository.

Sample README.md
Below is a sample README.md tailored for your A5 project. You can customize it further based on your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your machine. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Google Chrome** browser installed. [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- **Git** installed for cloning the repository. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up **A5** on your local machine.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/A5.git
cd A5
Set Up the Python Server
Navigate to the Python_server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Python_server
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file and add necessary configurations such as API keys.

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Run the Python Server:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
Install the Chrome Extension
Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.

Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.

Click on "Load unpacked" and select the Chrome_extension folder from the cloned repository.

The A5 extension should now appear in your list of extensions. Pin it to your toolbar for easy access.

Usage
Ensure the Python server is running.

Click on the A5 Chrome extension icon in your browser toolbar.

Enter your desired command in the input field provided.

Submit the command, and A5 will execute the task using the Browser Use library.

Monitor the output directly within the extension interface or via the Python server logs.
